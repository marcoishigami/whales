        <dd> Whales are large, intelligent sea mammals that live in oceans around the world. They breathe air through lungs, give birth to live babies, and feed them with milk. Some whales have baleen to filter tiny food like krill, while others have teeth to catch fish. The blue whale is the biggest animal on Earth. Whales often travel in groups
             and use sounds to talk to each other. </dd>
